# Boolean-Engine
This C++ tool manipulates Boolean functions using Positional Cube Notation (PCN). It implements the Recursive Complement Algorithm (Shannon Expansion) with binate-splitting heuristics to handle NOT, AND, and OR operations. Designed for EDA applications, it processes command scripts to read, transform, and output logic cubes.
